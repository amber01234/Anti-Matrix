We the teenagers want to get a good lifestyle but never taught how to do so. 
This site is specially for teenagers as we can find many sites which say that they will give 
some xyz amount of money , but they don't .
This is my own experience and i want you all to put efforts in order to achieve success.
It is my humble request that don't use this as addiction can happen .
2-3 times a week is great .
